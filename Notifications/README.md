#Notifications

## What

A notification is a service that runs in the background to let the user know that something has occurred such as receiving a new facebook message.

Notifications typically will appear in one of two places. Either the status bar on most phones(top), or in the system bar on tablets(bottom).

Typically you'll expand a notification drawer to see all of your active notifications.
